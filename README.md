# [Empathy Prompts](https://empathyprompts.net/)

Prompts to consider when making things for others to use.

This project is geared towards anyone involved with making digital products. It is my hope that this reaches both:

- People who are not necessarily involved in the day-to-day part of the process, but who help shape things like budget, timeline, and scope, and
- People who work every day to help to give these products shape and form

These prompts are intended to help build empathy, not describe any one person's experience. These prompts are <em>not</em> intended to tokenize the experience of the individuals experiencing these conditions. For further reading about disability simulations, please refer to [Job van Achterberg](https://twitter.com/detonite)'s excellent presentation, [The Imitation Game](https://noti.st/jkva/tF5o8J/slides).
